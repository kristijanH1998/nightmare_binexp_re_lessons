pilot is an example of a vulnerable stack program where data put on the stack can, if its stack address is placed into RIP, be executed just like any other instruction from .text (code) segment. That means the stack is executable, and NX bit is disabled, so pushing shellcode on the stack and switching execution by overwriting return address and putting start of user input on the stack into RIP, will start executing that user input which is on the stack (in the form of shellcode in this exploit).
